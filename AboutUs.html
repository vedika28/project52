            Hello! My name is Vedika Agarwal. I am a student of Delhi Public School, Noida of class 8th. I am a person who
            tries to be positive about every aspect of life. This website helps introduce people to the fun and exciting
            ways
            to make origami, and try it out themselves too. <br>
            Origami is an ancient art form that is believed to have been around for nearly 2000 years,
            derived from the Japanese tradition of paper-folding. <br>

       <p>Origami is not only fun but is also beneficial for a child’s development:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Use of one’s fingers improves fine motor skills and brain development</li>
            <li>It develops imagination and a sense of color</li>
            <li>It improves concentration and spatial awareness</li>
